"""
This class will simulate a single delivery truck using data from the other modules we created.

Each Truck object keeps track of its own:
- package list
- mileage
- current location
- and simulated time (which we will assume starts at 8:00AM unless specified otherwise)

The confusing thing that took me a while to figure out was that there's no actual "movement" â€” it's all a simulation (we
are NOT building a turtle race). The algorithm we will use is the nearest neighbor algorithm. We'll use the distance
and speed of the truck to calculate the delivery time. Once the delivery has been made we will update its delivery time
and status, which will be stored in the packag ebject. Then at the end we can compare all the delivery times
and print the status.
