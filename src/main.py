"""
This is the main part of our program that will also include the nice interface for the user to view the delivery status
of the packages and the total mileage traveled by all the trucks.


Here's what happens behind the scenes:
- We first load package data from a CSV file (`packages_data.csv`) into a custom hash table.
- Then we load the address list and distance matrix from their respective CSVs. The addresses are used to match
  each delivery location to its position (index) in the distance matrix.
- We create three truck objects, each with a starting time and a list of package IDs.
- Each truck delivers its assigned packages using the nearest neighbor algorithm (in `truck.py`),
  which figures out the next closest delivery address based on distance.

As trucks deliver packages, the program:
- Tracks how far each truck travels
- Calculates delivery time based on speed (18 MPH) and distance
- Updates the status and delivery time of each package in the hash table

Finally, we simulate time. The user can enter any time of day (e.g., 09:30), and we check the delivery time
of each package to determine its status at that time:
- "At hub" if the truck hasn't left yet
- "En route" if the truck is on the way
- "Delivered" with the timestamp if it's already been dropped off

I should also note that this tecnically isn't a real-time simulation. Everything is calculated instantly, and the
statuses are based purely on comparing the userâ€™s input time to the pre-calculated delivery time of each package.

because it has that unique triangle format, we need to accommodate this by
only contains half of the distances
our code checks both [i][j] and [j][i] when looking up distances in truck.py.
