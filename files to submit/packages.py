"""
As mentioned in the hashtable.py file, we need to create package objects that contain all the information we need.
We'll do this by creating a class (aka a package blueprint) that creates these objects, assigning the individual pieces
of data we need (address, city, etc.) as attributes.
That way we can easily access all the information quickly and efficiently (this is why we love OOP).
We will get the package data from a csv file I created (packages_data.csv), based on the WGUPS Package File Excel sheet
provided in the instructions.

    # Addding this so that I can check the objects by printing their actual data instead of the object's address in memory
